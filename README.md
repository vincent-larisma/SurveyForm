# Survey Form - [project 2 in Avion school (bootcamp)] 
>**This project intends to develop the html skill of the user in regards to survey form.**

## What the user learned
>**I learned HTML5 forms and how it works and basic CSS3.**

## Things to take note
>**Each project is not tampered with after being completed except for the readme file as this is a way to showcase the development of the user in each project as each project is a new experience for this user. The javascript code is not created by the user as this was provided by my instructor in Avion School.**
